## 3. Problem Statement
In today’s globalized world, language barriers create significant communication challenges. People traveling, working, or collaborating with individuals from different linguistic backgrounds often face difficulties in understanding and being understood.

Existing translation apps often require manual input and switching between languages, making communication slow and cumbersome.

There is a need for a seamless, automatic, and bidirectional text translation system that works naturally during written conversations.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A web and mobile application that can automatically translate text in real time into the user’s preferred language, and vice versa.

Users can type or paste text in their native language, and the app will instantly translate and display the message in the target language, enabling smooth communication between people who don’t share a common language.

The app will support multiple global languages, offer customization options, and ensure high translation accuracy with minimal latency.
